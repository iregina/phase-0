Describe what open source means.

Open source means that your project is freely available to anyone to look at, use, modify, or redistribute. 

What do you think about Open Source? Does it make you nervous or protective? Does it feel like utopia?
Assess the importance of using licenses.

I love the idea of Open Source projects. While I think every society needs a little bit of non-Open source, I think generally the idea of Open Source is amazing because there are so many amazing ideas and talent out there that needs to be utilitize. Especially since a lot of my favorite tools came from Open Sourced projects, I think at the end of day making things Open Source is better for all and will create a sense of utopia. At the same time, if there is a particular industry like healthcare or the government where revealing certain projects may comprimise highly sensitive information, then it should be not be open Source and maybe just limited to select folks. 

What concepts were solidified in the challenge? Did you have any "aha" moments? What did you struggle with?

In this challenge, I had a little challenge with identifying the difference between fork and branch, and I did a bit of googling which only made me more confused. However, when I practice pulling and pushing commits a couple more times in this challenge, I kind of got the idea of what the difference with forking and branching is -- forking is essentially somethign that hapepns if you are working off someone else's project. You wouldn't fork your own project (as I learned by clicking fork mulitple times on my own repos) and branching is very indispensible and it's normal to delete them with each new commit. I feel a lot more comfortable push and adding branches to my repos -- before I was scared that something would break. Thus, I think the concepts that were solidifed in this challenge was making commits to projects and creating new repos. One thing I would like to practice more is removing commits and reverting projects back to original states.

I couldn't figure out how to remove a branch locally because I wasn't sure if deleting it on github affect my local branch. So I used this site and it was super straightforward and helpful.

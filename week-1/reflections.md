### 1.1 Think About Time Reflection

The topic of time management and productivity because more people are beginning to attribute that to success in life and workplace than innate abilities.

Ironically, for today's module (1.1 Think about Time), I did not practice ideal time management. While reading through the given material, I found myself spending just as much time on Facebook and Amazon. My procrastination hit an all-time low when I began finding myself reading about the differences between whole milk and skim milk's hydrophilic and hydrophobic properties.

What I thought would be a one hour task turned into two.

However, through this module, I did a few new ideas about time management and productivity that I can use right away for the next section. One technique I learned is to give myself a stricter deadline to complete assignments. The idea is to challenge myself to accomplish things within a reasonable amount of time and stick to it. I think part of the reason I ended up taking so long to finish this assignment was because I knew that I didn't have any pressing appointments later today that would make it imperative for me to accomplish today's module. Another idea I learned is to first spend time understanding what my attention span is like and what amount of focus I can provide. One way is the set up an alarm in specific time intervals and note which times caused me to find the alarms catching me off guard. If I find myself watching and waiting for the alarm to sound, I have to give myself a shorter period of time to concentrate and incorporate a break before then.

I also learned about the phrase "time boxing." In practice, I've done it before but never gave it a name. Essentially, time box is a set amount of time assigned to a task. When I set a timebox for something, I must accomplish it within that time. When the time is up, I must stop and reflect on how much I have accomplished. I can practice time boxing in phase 0 by assigning specific time to complete certain sections within modules. For example, if I gave a timebox to module 1.1, I would set it to 55 minutes and leave 5 minutes for reflection.

Currently, I manage my time by writing down a list of all the things I need to accomplish today. I set up a vague schedule, like from 9 am to 11 am work on Devbootcamp 11 am to 12 pm exercise

I think my current strategy is not working because I don't stick to my vague schedule. I think part of the problem is that I'm not specific enough about what I need to accomplish. It's broad and the time I gave to each task is not realistic and carefully thought out.

Given the techniques I read in today's module, one thing I should practice each morning is meditation so that I don't get overwhelmed with feeling like I need to accomplish a million things a day, which is what my post-it notes makes me feel like. Instead, I should make small specific steps and start my day from there. It would make me feel more manageable and more confident about my abilities to be productive.

I think it's possible for my employ these two major techniques: meditate in the morning and start my day with small actionable tasks. I believe I have the ability to do this and can hold myself accountable by keeping a log in a journal of what I did each day.

My overall plan for Phase 0 is to incorporate my devbootcamp work into a daily habit, starting with medication and a few small goals each morning. From then on, I can either move onto a new goal or end the day feeling productive and focused. To keep myself accountable, I should keep a record in my notebook and refer to it daily to make sure I am on task. 

### 1.2 The Command Line Reflection

What is a shell? What is "bash?"
Shell is the user-interface for interacting with the operating system. Bash is a type of shell for computers that use the UNIX operating system.

What was the most challenging for you in going through this material?
The most challenging thing for me was that there were a lot of terms and concepts being discussed that I did not totally understand at first. For example, the video and the Crash Course guide made a lot of references to shell, terminal, and Bash - and I did not completely understand the difference. So I spent a bit of time looking online and reading different explanations of the differences. Similar things happened when I began learning about commands. The Crash Course guide would have me work through an exercise and then explain to me what I was doing. However, even after doing the exercise and reading the explanation, I did not pick up exactly what I was doing. This required me to go back on Google and look up at other explanations and examples. Something, I found resources that explained things more clearly to me. Other time, I would find really in-depth articles that would bring up more new concepts, which required me to do googling. And something that is frustrating because I want a quick and dirty explanation, but the truth is, in computing, there are a lot of rules exceptions and use-cases. 

Were you able to successfully use all of the commands?
Yes, towards the end of the Crash Course guide, there were a few commands where I'm still not entirely sure of why I would be using it anytime soon. Nevertheless, I was able to follow all the instructions in the guide and successfully use them. 

In your opinion, what are the most important commands and arguments to know?
I love opening and moving between directories, and think think that is the most important commands to know because they make it so much faster and easier to go look through different folders. I can imagine myself using them a lot from now on to open files.

Can you remember what each of the following does of the top of your head? Write what each does.

-pwd - print working directory, shows what directory you are in

-ls - list out the components and files in the current directory

-mv - move files and folders, or changes the name

-cd - moves to a different directory

-../ - this is the home directory

-touch - I didn't remember this, but according to google, it's an easy way to create new empty files

-mkdir - makes a new directory

-less - shows the page view of a file

-rmdir - removes a directory, make sure there isn't anything inside though

-rm - removes (file or something)

-help - when you don't know what a certain command (I feel like Google would be more helpful than this command)


### 1.4 Forking and Cloning Reflection  

If you were going to write instructions for a new person on how to create a new repo, fork a repo, and clone a repo, what would they be? Why would you fork a repository as opposed to create a new one?
How to create, fork, and clone a repo: 

Create - Open up github.com, click on the "+" at the top right corner then "New Repository", then fill out the necessary information, and click "Create Repository"

Fork - Open up your desired repo and click on the "Fork" button on the top right corner 

Clone - On your forked repo Github page, find your SSH link and copy it. Open up terminal and your desired folder, then enter in "git clone [SSH Link]" then hit Enter. The repo will be saved to that folder and it may ask you for your github username and password to proceed. 

You would want to form a repository when you want to work on an existing repository and need your own version. It's important to for a repo so that you can your own version and not interfere with the main repo and anyone else's repo.  

What struggles did you have setting up git and GitHub? What did you learn in the process?
Because I had GitHub set up before, I didn't have any issues setting it up physically. I think the main struggle was understanding what exactly I was doing and what git exactly was (which I learned from the last section) Doing this exercise, I did spend a bit of time looking up why we had to put down MIT license and read on it. Learning about why this licensing was important was something new that I learned in the process. I never thought about how important it is to protect yourself as you writing and publish code on Github. I think in the future, I will try to remember to add the MIT license on everything I do and when the time comes, I will find out if I need to add or learn about other licenses.

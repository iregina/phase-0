**1. What does <puts> do?**    

<puts> is short for "puts string" and it's a command used for displaying the results of evaluating Ruby code. The <puts> command is often compared to the <print> command because they both display the results, but the difference is <puts> adds a newline after executing, whereas <print> does not.   
  
>*For Example, the following code:*   
<puts "hello">  
<puts "second line">  
<print "hello again!">  
<print "goodbye for now!">   
>
>*Will print this:*  
hello  
second line  
hello again!goodbye for now!  

**2. What is an integer? What is a float? **   
 
An integer is a number that can be written without a fractional component, or decimals. Float is a number with no fixed number of digits before and after the decimal point.  

>*Examples of Integers:*   
3, 5, 494, 100000, 204  
>
>*Examples of Floats:*  
2.0, 5.25, 1394.3948538, 0002.0000 

**3.What is the difference between float and integer division? How would you explain the difference to someone who doesn't know anything about programming?**    

The difference between float and integer division is apparent when a number is being divided by a non-integer.   

In float division, the number will come out accurately, as in. In other words, if 10 / 4 will equal 2.5. However, integer divisions only results in integers and if the output isn't an integer/perfectly divided, it will round down to nearest integer. In the case of the above example, that would have been 2.

>*Integer Division:*    
10 / 3 =  3 

>*Float Division:*    
10 / 3 = 3.33333...

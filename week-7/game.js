// Design Basic Game Solo Challenge

// This is a solo challenge

// Your mission description: 
// Overall mission: To make a cake.
// Goals: Make the batter, decorate the cake 
// Characters: Me
// Objects: Cake, Frosting
// Functions: Mix Ingredients Bake the cake frost the cake

// Pseudocode
// 1. Combine all the ingredients for baking a cake in a mixing bowl 
// 2. Mix the ingredient
// 5. Place pan in oven 
// 6. Take out cake and cool it 
// 7. Mix the ingredients for frosting
// 8. Frost the cake

// Initial Code
var pantry = {
	batter = ["flour", "eggs", "milk", "baking powder"]
	frosting = ["powdered sugar", "whipping cream", "vanilla"]
}

var supplies = {
	oven: "gas"
	bowl: "mixing"
	pan: "12-inch"
}

var mix = function(ingredient){
	return "you just combined" + " " + ingredient;
}

var cook = function(tool){
	return "you just placed your cake in the" + " " + tool;
}

var frost = function(){
	return "you just frosted your cake"
}





// Refactored Code






// Reflection
// What was the most difficult part of this challenge?
// I still don't understand how to build a game like this and need to look at more examples. 

// What did you learn about creating objects and functions that interact with one another?
// It's quite exciting! 
// Did you learn about any new built-in methods you could use in your refactored solution? If so, what were they and how do they work?
// Not in this challenge
// How can you access and manipulate properties of objects?
// you have to put down object.ingredient in that type of syntax 
//

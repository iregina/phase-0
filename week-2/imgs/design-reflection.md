<li> What are the 6 Phases of Web Design? 
	<ol>
	<li>Information Gathering - Have a good understanding of the company the website is being created for, including its business goals and how the web can help achieve these goals.</li>
	<li>Planning - develop a site map and find how what technologies should be implemented </li>
	<li>Design - determine the look and feel of the site wiht the target audience in mind and also incorporate elements of the company logo and branding, a few prototypes will be created, and allow you to view your project throughout the design and development stage </li>
	<li>Development - the point where the site itself is created and turn the graphic elements from the prototype and crate an actual functional site </li>
	<li>Testing and Delivery - attend to the final details of the site and test functions and ensure the code written for the web site validates; the designer uses an FTP program to upload the web site files to the server and maybe setups your domain name registration and web hosting services; might run plugin installation and SEO optimization. </li>
	<li>Maintenance - make sures new content and products are updates on a regular basis and maybe regular site backups, WordPress ugrades, and addiitoinal plugin installation</li>
	</ol>
</li>

<li> What is your site's primary goal or purpose? What kind of content will your site feature? 
	The primary purpose of my site is to serve as an online portfolio to show off my work. I will be posting projects I've worked on as well as information about my background. I might also include a blog to document my progress in the course. 
</li>

<li> What is your target audience's interests and how do you see your site addressing them? 
	My target audience will be potential employers and maybe my parents, so they can see what I've been working on these days. Their interests will be mainly to find out who I am and what I've done and capable of building. My site would have my projects show on them and make it easy for them to get a feel for what I've built.
</li>
<li> What is the primary "action" the user should take when coming to your site? Do you want them to search for information, contact you, or see your portfolio? It's ok to have several actions at once, or different actions for different kinds of visitors.
	When users are coming to my site, they should be able to see my work right away and if they are interested in learning more, then can click on my projects to find out information. I will have a link at the top that lets them click to learn more about me. I also will have my contact information on my page for them to email me or look at my social media handles.

What are the main things someone should know about design and user experience?
Design and user experience are essential parts of the web design process because good design ensures that the website is serving its purpose.

What is user experience design and why is it valuable? 
User experience design is studying and evaluating and making decisions based on how a person feels when interfacing with a system (usually a form of human-computer interaction). User experience design is valuable because it ensures that our website is serving its purpose and it fulfills our user's needs, rather than just our own (the website creator). A website must be designed with its users in mind to ensure that the website's designs and asethetics are effective and creates an ideal experience. 
</li>
Which parts of the challenge did you find tedious? 
The most tedious part of the challnege is creating new branches and moving the images from downloads to my right folder. I'm still not comfortable with Command Line so for me to go through new folders and take action still requires me to reference check which takes a little longer than I would like.

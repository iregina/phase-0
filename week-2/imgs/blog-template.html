How was it to wireframe and create an HTML page with a pair?
It was pretty fun and straightforward to create a wireframe with a new friend and create a HTML page.

Did you find wireframing to be helpful to your development process?
It definetely did in terms of making sure that both my partner and I were on the same page and knew where we were going.

What did you and your pair decide made a good wireframe? 
A good wireframe is something that clearly shows what elements are going to be on the page. 

What new semantic elements did you learn about (if any)?
I learned about <header> semantic elements. I don't think I've come across it before.

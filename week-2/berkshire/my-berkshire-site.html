  <!-- 
- What was it like to translate your previous learning with HTML into an actual site?
THIS was awesome. I can't believe I was able to recreate a live actualy site, especially since I've heard about Berkshire Hathaway's simple website design before. I'm surprise we were able to accomplish this all within an hour.
- How was it researching and using semantic HTML5 elements?
It was so easy. I pretty much was able to find resources on everything I was look for - the internet is amazing.
- How did you do at keeping to best practices (i.e. no formatting in the HTML)
I think just practicing a lot is the best way at keeping best practicies. When I'm coding with someone else, it helps too because they remind me when I make a mistake and I never forget it afterwards.
- What seems good and bad about HTML?
I think there's still so much I do know about HTML and rules I don't understand, which is the bad part about HTML. The good part about HTML is that it's pretty straightforward to use and work with when building a site. I like how uniform a lot of the HTML tags are - it makes it easier to understand where everything is. 
- What tricks do you have for remembering how to write HTML?
My tricks are just to practice typing out new HTML a lot - I think by typing it out, I remember it a little better. That's about the only "trick" I use to remember HTML.

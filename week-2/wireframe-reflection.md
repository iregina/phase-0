#Reflection

<ol>
	<li><strong>What is a wireframe?</strong>A wireframe is a visual plan of how a user interface is going to look.</li>
	<li>What are the benefits of wireframing? It makes it easier for you to plan out layouts and determining how a user would interact with your interface. </li>
	<li>Did you enjoy wireframing your site? I did, it was a lot of fun and a lot easier and also harder than I thought. I used pen and paper so it felt like drawing. </li>
	<li>Did you revise your wireframe or stick with your first idea? Yes, multiple times - I realized that an idea might sound like a good idea in my head. However, once I saw it on paper, it didn't look as great as I thought it would. I also showed my design to my boyfriend and asked him if my wireframe made sense, and he gave me a lot of feedback which caused me to change my design a few times. </li>
	<li>What questions did you ask during this challenge? What resources did you find to help you answer them? I was not sure what grid systems were and how they worked. That part is still a little confusing to me because I think the grid system is going to be a lot important in the future when we begin designating where each button and feature should go on a webpage. I actually just looked at the examples of wireframes and observed how they marked their grids to get a feel for what the grid system would look like in wireframes. It seems that there are universal grid systems, but it's important to consult with the developer and the entire team to figure out what the grid/parameters will be for the project. </li>
	<li>Which parts of the challenge did you enjoy and which parts did you find tedious? I enjoyed learning about the work life of a UX designer. The part I found tedious was learning about UX theory, because as said in the article, not all UX techinques are practiced, especially in companies with tight budgets, resources and deadlines. </li>

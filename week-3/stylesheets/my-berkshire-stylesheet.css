Q: What is important to know when linking an 
external file (like a stylesheet) to an HTML file?
A: Make sure that you link to the correct file by checking
the file's location in relation to the html file. 


A: What tricks did you use to help you with positioning? 
How hard was it to get the site as you wanted it?
Q: It was super challenging to get the site to look the
way we wanted. My pairing partner and I had a lot of difficulties
trying to fix a lot of formatting issues. With 
positioning, we just had to play around a lot of options
before finding the right one. For example, we were a bit
confused by inline-block and block. 

What CSS did you use to modify the element style 
(like size, color, etc.)
We used font-size a lot, color, and a CSS element
that made the first letter capitalized. 

Did you modify the HTML to include classes or ids? 
If so, which did you choose and why? If you didn't, 
how would you know which one to add to your HTML?
When you compared your site to the actual code base, 
which do you think had cleaner code that followed best 
practices and why?
We mainly used classes because we found that we could 
resuse a lot of the same formatting for many sections. 
Also, we were more comfortable with classes and didn't
really want to mess with IDs. I'm sure the original site
had a cleaner code base and practices because there
were def. a lot of inefficiencies in our code base
mainly because we were not familiar with a lot of the
CSS elements and were still learning as we go. However, our code base
is still a lot cleaner than than the one we had in the beginning
of our session.

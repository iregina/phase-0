	<h3>What is Git?</h3>

	Git is a type of version control system. Git helps you keep track of changes as you are working on a file or project. When you input Git commands during your work, you are essentially take snapshots of all the changes you made during that time and it stores the changes you made into a local repository.

	<h3>What is Github?</h3>

	Github is the website where we send our projects to be compiled, changed, or pulled from by anyone. 

	GitHub is like the all time mecca for code. Why use GitHub you ask? Its lightning quick and everyone uses it. Its like the dropbox for code! That means everyone can access everyone elses work, clone it, and work on it themselves. Its great for team projects or anything that requires multiple people to do. Its easy to use and easy to understand. I think learning Git is the hard part and learning how to use GitHub is easier. Once I get more used to using Git and GitHub I think that organizing and working on my projects will definitely be alot more fluid. I wanna learn more and start making some cool stuff. Im excited for the weeks to come!
